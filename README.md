Data and scripts for analysing Paspaley jewellery.

Paspaley make the best pearl jewellery in the world. Monica loves them, and she loves statistics, so I thought it would make a nice example of an start-to-end data analysis project where we have to gather, clean and analysis the data in a real world setting.

I happened to scrape their website on Boxing Day 2017, and I did that again on Boxing Day 2018, and again on Boxing Day 2019, and I just did it again on Boxing Day 2020. So we have four snapshots.

If you just want the cleaned and organised dataset then you want: outputs/data/cleaned_dataset.csv

Scripts contain various R scripts. In general, it's not very well organised and it's just various scripts for each year. At some point come back and clean everything up.

Inputs is generally their raw html files. I'm not sharing those publicly to avoid copyright issues, but if you're wanting to reproduce the analysis end to end (and hence need the older website scrapes then please get in touch). Finally, outputs are the data files that I created.
