Data and scripts for analysing Paspaley jewellery.

Paspaley make the best pearl jewellery in the world. Monica loves them, and she loves statistics, so I thought it would make a nice example of an start-to-end data analysis project where we have to gather, clean and analysis the data in a real world setting.

I happened to scrape their website on Boxing Day 2017, and I did that again on Boxing Day 2018. So we have two snapshots.
